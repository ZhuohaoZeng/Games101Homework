# Modern Computer Graphics
Built core modules: transformation matrices, triangle rasterizer with Z-buffering, Blinn–Phong shading with texture/bump/displacement mapping, Bézier curve rendering, ray–triangle intersection, and BVH traversal.  
Gained extensive experience translating math (linear algebra, numerical methods) into performant C++ code, with debugging, modular design, and optimization for rendering tasks.

## HW1: Rotation and Projection
### Features
- **get_model_matrix(float rotation_angle):**  
  Construct the model transformation matrix and return it. Only the rotation matrix around the 3D z-axis is implemented, without handling translation or scaling.
  
- **get_projection_matrix(float eye_fov, float aspect_ratio, float zNear, float zFar):**  
  Construct the perspective projection matrix using the given parameters and return it.
